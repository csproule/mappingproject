									<p><br> <br>NOTES IN nsyilxcən is a project that aims to map the places, plants, and wildlife of Vernon BC using the Okanagan Indigenous language, Nsyilxcən. I have left tangible “notes” around the city with words in Nsyilxcən (and their English translation) that describe a variety of things in the area. </p>
<p>
My understanding of my hometown has grown immensely throughout this project, as a result of both the research I did about Okanagan history and also from conversations I had with strangers as I scattered notes across the city. While I wanted to expand my personal relationship with my hometown, the second intention of this project was to expose others to the language; hopefully when people stumble upon these notes it will spark reflection. I want to remind others that the things that surround them have names in Nsyilxcən, and have had these names long before first contact. I haven’t included a ton of detail on the notes because I feel that it is not my place to educate others on Indigenous culture, but instead encourage others to seek out information on their own and learn more about Nsyilxcən and the Syilx community that have spoken it for thousands of years. 
</p>
                                    <h4><br>Future Steps</h4>
                                    <p>If this project is to continue, I would like the next phase to focus more on Vernon’s downtown core. I often notice others speak about Indigenous culture and language in the context of the past, and to be honest I catch myself doing this as well, and I think this can be a harmful way of thinking. Indigenous people are still here, and are keeping there cultural practises and languages alive; by bringing nsyilxcən into the center of the city, identifying coffee shops and ATMS, will hopefully remind others that this language is being used right now and it is not a thing of the past.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4><br>Materials</h4>
                                    <p>It was important to me that the materials I used to make the notes would not disrupt the plants, wildlife, and people that occupy these spaces. Papermaking has been an interest of mine for a few years, and I have recently been looking into "seed paper", which seemed like the perfect material to use for this project. I chose native wildflowers that will not only make these space more beautiful but will also support pollinators this Spring.</p>
